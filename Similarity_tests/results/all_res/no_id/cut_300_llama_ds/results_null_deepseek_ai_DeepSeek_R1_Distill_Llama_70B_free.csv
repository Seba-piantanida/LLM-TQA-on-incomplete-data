Okay, so the user wants movie recommendations but specifically mentions avoiding movies like 'Dancer in the Dark'. I need to figure out what makes 'Dancer in the Dark' a movie they don't like and then find opposite or different movies in the dataset.

First, I should look at 'The Taste of Tea' in the dataset. It's a 2004 Comedy/Fantasy film directed by Katsuhito Ishii.
