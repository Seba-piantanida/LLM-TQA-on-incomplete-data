Okay, so the user is asking for movie recommendations that are the opposite of 'Only Yesterday'. Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what 'Only Yesterday' is like. From the dataset, it's an animated, drama, romance film from 1991 with a 7.6 AVG score. It's directed by Isao Takahata, known for Studio Ghibli, so it's probably emotional, character-driven, and maybe a bit slow-paced.

The user wants the opposite, so I should look for films that are different in genre, tone, ",30x9,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,10,3,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30x10,no_id,['IMDB_id'],

Okay, so the user didn't like 'Dancer in the Dark' and is looking for something else to watch. Let me figure out why they didn't like it and what they might prefer instead.

First, I'll look at 'Dancer in the Dark'. It's a 2000 film directed by Lars von Trier, known for his intense, often dark, and emotionally challenging movies. The genres are Crime, Drama, and Musical. It has a high AVG score of 7.9 and a lot of votes, so it's well-regarded but maybe too heavy or not the user's taste.

Okay, I need to help the user by recommending movies based on 'Rosewood'. Let me start by looking at the details of 'Rosewood' in the dataset. 

'Rosewood' is from 1997, directed by John Singleton, and the genres are Action, Drama, History. The main cast includes Jon Voight, Ving Rhames, and Don Cheadle. It has an AVG score of 7.2 and 9220 votes.

Okay, so the user wants movie recommendations but specifically mentions avoiding movies like 'The Last King of Scotland'. I need to figure out what makes 'The Last King of Scotland' a movie they don't like and then find movies that are the opposite or different in style, genre, or theme.

First, I'll look up 'The Last King of Scotland' in the dataset. It's a 2006 film with genres Biography, Drama, History. It's directed by Kevin Macdonald and has a high AVG_score of 7.6 with a lot of vot",30x9,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,10,10,False,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,30x10,no_id,['IMDB_id'],

First, I'll look at 'Twilight' in the dataset. It's a 2008 film with genres Drama, Fantasy, Romance. The main cast includes Kristen Stewart and Billy Burke. The AVG_score is 5.3, which is on the lower side, so the user probably didn't connect with it.

The main plot revolves around a teenage girl falling in love with a vampire, which is quite romantic and fantastical. The user is looking for something opposite to this, so I should focus on genres that are different from Drama, Fantasy, and Romance.

Here are 10 recommendations that are different from 'A Christmas Carol':
