Okay, so the user loved 'The Legend of Tarzan' and wants similar movie recommendations. Let me think about what makes 'The Legend of Tarzan' unique. It's an action-adventure film with elements of drama and maybe some romance, set in a jungle environment. The main themes probably involve survival, adventure, and perhaps some conflict between civilization and the wild.

Looking at the dataset, I need to find movies that share these elements. Let's go through each movie one by one.

It's a sports comedy, specifically about golf, with a lot of humor and a underdog story. The main character is a former hockey player who turns to golf, so there's a fish-out-of-water element. The movie has a lot of slapstick humor and witty dialogue.

First, I know 'Twilight' is a supernatural romance film with vampires and a lot of teen drama. It's probably slow-paced and focuses on relationships. If the user found it boring, maybe they're looking for something with more action, different themes, or a faster pace.
