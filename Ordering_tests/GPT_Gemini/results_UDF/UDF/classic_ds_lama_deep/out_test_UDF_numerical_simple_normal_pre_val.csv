Alright, so I need to figure out how to respond to the user's query. They want me to return the gap between current weight_kg and the target weight for a BMI of 21, ranked descending, and show the top 5 entries. 

First, I should understand what the target weight is. Since BMI is calculated as weight (kg) / (height (m))², setting BMI to 21 allows me to solve for the target weight. The formula rearranged would be target_weight = 21 * (height_m)².

Next, I need to calculate the current weight minus the target weight to find the gap. However, I should check if the user wants the absolute difference or just the difference as is. Since they didn't specify, I'll assume they want the actual difference, which could be positive or negative, indicating whether someone is above or below the target.

Looking at the dataset, I see that each entry has id, name, height_m, weight_kg, BMI, and risk_category. I'll need to compute the target weight for each person and then find the difference between their current weight and this target.

I'll go through each entry:

1. For Alice, height is 1.65m. Target weight is 21*(1.65)^2 = 21*2.7225 = 57.0725 kg. Current weight is 90.6 kg. Difference is 90.6 - 57.0725 = 33.5275 kg.
2. Bob's height is 1.88m. Target weight is 21*(1.88)^2 = 21*3.5344 = 74.2324 kg. Current weight is 57.8 kg. Difference is 57.8 - 74.2324 = -16.4324 kg.
3. Carla's height is 1.79m. Target weight is 21*(1.79)^2 = 21*3.2041 = 67.2861 kg. Current weight is 49.9 kg. Difference is 49.9 - 67.2861 = -17.3861 kg.
4. David's height is 1.74m. Target weight is 21*(1.74)^2 = 21*3.0276 = 63.5796 kg. Current weight is 116.2 kg. Difference is 116.2 - 63.5796 = 52.6204 kg.
5. Emma's height is 1.56m. Target weight is 21*(1.56)^2 = 21*2.4336 = 51.1356 kg. Current weight is 117.4 kg. Difference is 117.4 - 51.1356 = 66.2644 kg.
6. Frank's height is 1.56m. Same target as Emma, 51.1356 kg. Current weight is 105.6 kg. Difference is 105.6 - 51.1356 = 54.4644 kg.

8. Helen's height is 1.85m. Target weight is 21*(1.85)^2 = 21*3.4225 = 71.8725 kg. Current weight is 52.3 kg. Difference is 52.3 - 71.8725 = -19.5725 kg.
9. Ian's height is 1.74m. Target weight is 63.5796 kg. Current weight is 96.3 kg. Difference is 96.3 - 63.5796 = 32.7204 kg.
10. Jack's height is 1.78m. Target weight is 21*(1.78)^2 = 21*3.1684 = 66.5364 kg. Current weight is 78 kg. Difference is 78 - 66.5364 = 11.4636 kg.
11. Karen's height is 1.51m. Target weight is 21*(1.51)^2 = 21*2.2801 = 47.8821 kg. Current weight is 54.2 kg. Difference is 54.2 - 47.8821 = 6.3179 kg.
12. Leo's height is 1.89m. Target weight is 21*(1.89)^2 = 21*3.5721 = 74.9841 kg. Current weight is 82.1 kg. Difference is 82.1 - 74.9841 = 7.1159 kg.
